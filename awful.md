# 🌟 The Awful Manifesto

*“Awful projects are fully done, calmly maintained, and eternally useful.”*

An **Awful** project or list is not “bad.”
It is **Awfully complete**, **Awfully stable**, and **Awfully useful** — so much that it no longer needs rapid development or change.

This repo contains both:

* **Awful Lists** – curated collections of such projects
* **Individual Awful Projects** – standalone tools or repos that are fully developed and passively maintained

This manifesto defines what “Awful” means and how Awful content should be created, curated, and respected.

---

# 🎯 What is an Awful List?

An **Awful List** is a curated, structured collection of:

* **Fully developed** projects
* **Passively maintained** tools
* **Useful** and reliable utilities
* **Calm** and stable codebases that no longer evolve rapidly

Awful Lists avoid chaos.
They highlight projects that are already *done* — not those chasing the next major version.

> **Awful = finished, stable, useful.**

---

# 🧱 What is an Individual Awful Project?

The Awful ecosystem also supports standalone **Awful Projects**, not just lists.

An **Awful Project** must be:

* **Fully completed** — It reached its intended scope.
* **Stable** — No breaking changes or big features coming.
* **Passively maintained** — Only minor updates or fixes when absolutely required.
* **Useful** — Even simple utilities qualify if they solve real problems.
* **Documented** — Clear README with purpose, usage, and status.
* **Minimal** — No over-engineering; no unnecessary complexity.

Examples include:

* A finished command-line tool.
* A stable library with near-zero future changes.
* A single-file script that solves one problem perfectly.
* A static website tool that needs no dynamic backend.
* A micro-app whose feature set is complete.

If it is **done**, **useful**, and **calm**, it is **Awful**.

# 🎭 Awful vs Awesome

Awesome lists celebrate cutting-edge, active, evolving work.
**Awful lists celebrate finalized, stable, peaceful work that has reached maturity.**

Awful values:

* **Completion over expansion**
* **Stability over constant updates**
* **Simplicity over complexity**
* **Utility over hype**

---

# 🪪 Awful Badge

Every Awful List or Awful Project *must* include the Awful badge at the top of its README.

# 📝 Comment on why something is Awful

A project should not be listed or included just because it exists.
Tell your readers **why** it is Awful:

* Does it solve a problem simply and effectively?
* Has it already reached full maturity?
* Is it known for stability and reliability?
* Does it follow the ethos of passive, calm maintenance?

Every addition must include a clear explanation.

---

# 🎚️ Clarify the scope

Your Awful List or Awful Project must have a clear purpose.

* Describe its scope in the README.
* Avoid mixing unrelated content.
* If something belongs to another Awful List, link to it instead.

The Awful ecosystem thrives on **clarity** and **boundaries**.

---

# ✍️ Grammar Matters

Awful doesn’t mean low-quality.
Ensure:

* Proper grammar
* Correct punctuation
* No typos
* Clean Markdown formatting

Pull requests should maintain this standard.

---

# 📄 Choose an Appropriate License

If you don't select a license, others are *not* allowed to use your work.

For Awful projects/lists, the recommended license is:

* **CC0** for lists
* **MIT or Apache-2.0** for code (optional)
* Any license that allows reuse is fine, but avoid unlicensed repos.

---

# 🤝 Include Contribution Guidelines

Your list or project must include a clear **CONTRIBUTING.md** explaining:

* How to contribute
* What qualifies as Awful
* Formatting rules
* Pull request process

If you want, you can adapt our default `contributing.md` file.

---

# 🧩 Stylize your list / project properly

* Include a **table of contents**
* Group related content into clear categories
* Use consistent formatting
* Keep descriptions short and ending with a period
* Use icons or images if they add clarity

Awful content should be readable, scannable, and calm.

---

# 👥 Respect Others' Opinions

The Awful community values peace and calm.

* Be open to feedback.
* If many users disagree with your decision, consider adjusting.
* Do not dismiss differing opinions immediately.
* Maintain kindness and neutrality.

---

# 🧘 The Awful Philosophy

* Finished is beautiful.
* Simplicity is powerful.
* Calm maintenance is a virtue.
* Tools don’t need endless updates to be valuable.
* Perfection is not constant change — it’s stability.

Awful is a celebration of **work that’s done — and done well.**
